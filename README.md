###known issues

**no namebug**
- submitting a blank name creates a cookie, the UI stays because the cookie has no name property, because the UI stays the same the cookie cannot be deleted (delete option is only given when cookie with name property is set) 
- solution: waiting to see if it's fixed in exercises before attempting fix





**Questions**
- scope of route in express.js file
- when to use next() in express.js
- should all console.logs be removed before submission?
